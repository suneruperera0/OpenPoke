# OpenPoke 🌴

## Take-home: bounded agent discovery

As persistent agents accumulate, original OpenPoke includes every agent name in
its interaction prompt: about 501 B at 10 agents and 25 KB at 500. This submission
replaces that full roster with a ranked shortlist of **at most 8 agents / 4,096
UTF-8 bytes**, plus on-demand directory search and explicit agent creation/reuse.
Field-aware BM25-style retrieval improves owner discovery within the same bound.

On the **same fresh synthetic holdout at 500 agents**, shortlist owner recall
improved from **25% (V1) to 86.7% (V2)**, with a maximum roster block of **2,453 B**
and zero bound violations. A separate two-case live sanity check routed correctly
in both arms; its budget-limited results are described in the report.

Start with the [final report and reproduction commands](evals/RETRIEVAL_V2.md).
The [baseline measurement](evals/BASELINE.md) and [historical V1 evaluation](evals/ROUTING_README.md)
preserve the problem → implementation → evaluation → retrieval improvement story.

After installing backend dependencies, run the offline tests from the repo root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s evals -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The offline evaluation needs no API credits or Gmail connection. App setup follows.

## Original application


OpenPoke is a simplified, open-source take on [Interaction Company’s](https://interaction.co/about) [Poke](https://poke.com/) assistant—built to show how a multi-agent orchestration stack can feel genuinely useful. It keeps the handful of things Poke is great at (email triage, reminders, and persistent agents) while staying easy to spin up locally.

- Multi-agent FastAPI backend that mirrors Poke's interaction/execution split, powered by [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
- Gmail tooling via [Composio](https://composio.dev/) for drafting/replying/forwarding without leaving chat.
- Trigger scheduler and background watchers for reminders and "important email" alerts.
- Next.js web UI that proxies everything through the shared `.env`, so plugging in API keys is the only setup.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Quickstart
1. **Clone and enter the repo.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suneruperera0/OpenPoke
   cd OpenPoke
   ```
2. **Create a shared env file.** Copy the template and open it in your editor:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. **Get your API keys and add them to `.env`:**
   
   **OpenRouter (Required)**
   - Create an account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
   - Generate an API key
   - Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual key in `.env`
   
   **Composio (Required for Gmail)**
   - Sign in at [composio.dev](https://composio.dev/)
   - Create an API key
   - Set up Gmail integration and get your auth config ID
   - Replace `your_composio_api_key_here` and `your_gmail_auth_config_id_here` in `.env`
4. **(Required) Create and activate a Python 3.10+ virtualenv:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're using Python 3.10+
   python3.10 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Verify Python version (should show 3.10+)
   python --version
   ```
   On Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   # Use Python 3.10+ (adjust path as needed)
   python3.10 -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # Verify Python version
   python --version
   ```

5. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   ```
6. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --prefix web
   ```
7. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   python -m server.server --reload
   ```
8. **Start the Next.js app (new terminal):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev --prefix web
   ```
9. **Connect Gmail for email workflows.** With both services running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), head to *Settings → Gmail*, and complete the Composio OAuth flow. This step is required for email drafting, replies, and the important-email monitor.

The web app proxies API calls to the Python server using the values in `.env`, so keeping both processes running is required for end-to-end flows.
